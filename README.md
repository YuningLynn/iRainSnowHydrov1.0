# iRainSnowHydrov1.0
iRainSnowHydro v1.0 was created by The National Key Laboratory of Water Disaster Prevention at Hohai University. The goal of iRainSnowHydro v1.0 is to provide a relatively accurate simulation and prediction for snowmelt-rainfall runoff, including (i) precipitation type judgement, (ii)runoff generation modes identification, (iii) water division calculation, and (iiii) runoff concentration calculation. The model mainly includes the a whole complete hydrological circulation. The model can currently process meteorological data and underlying surface data with different resolutions, allowing to carry out hydrological simulations in different precisions. iRainSnowHydro v1.0 is written in Fortran currently supporting Windows operating systems.
